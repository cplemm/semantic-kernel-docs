# Microsoft Agent Framework

The [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework)
is an open-source development kit for building **AI agents** and **multi-agent workflows**
with support for .NET and Python.
It is a significant evolution from the [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
and [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) projects, combining the best features of both while introducing new capabilities. It is developed by the same teams behind those projects,
and designed to be the unified foundation going forward.

The Agent Framework offers two primary categories of capabilities:

- [AI Agents](#ai-agents): single agents that use LLMs to process inputs,
  use tools and MCP servers to perform actions, and generate responses. Agents support
  different model providers including Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, and Azure AI.
- [Workflows](#workflows): graph-based workflows that connect multiple agents
  and functions to perform complex, multi-step tasks. Workflows support type-based routing,
  nesting, checkpointing, and request/response pattern for human-in-the-loop scenarios.

The framework also provides foundational building
blocks such as model clients, for both Chat Completion and Responses, to work with models,
agent thread for state management, context providers for agent memory,
middleware for intercepting agent actions, and MCP server clients for tool integration.
Together, these components give you the flexibility and power to build
interactive, robust and safe AI applications.

## Why another agent framework?

[Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
and [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) have been very successful
in pioneering the concept of AI agents and multi-agent orchestration.
Agent Framework is a direct descendant of these two projects created by the
creators of both. It takes the simplicity of AutoGen's abstractions for single
agent and multi-agent patterns, and combines with the enterprise-grade features
of Semantic Kernel such as thread-based state management, type safety, filters,
telemetry, and extensive model and embedding support. Beyond just merging the two,
Agent Framework also introduces workflows to give developers more control over
the execution path of multi-agent scenarios, and a robust state management system
for long-running processes and human-in-the-loop scenarios.
It is fair to say that Agent Framework is the next generation of
both Semantic Kernel and AutoGen.

To learn more about migrating from either Semantic Kernel or AutoGen,
see the [Migration Guide from Semantic Kernel](../migration-guide/from-semantic-kernel/index.md)
and [Migration Guide from AutoGen](../migration-guide/from-autogen/index.md).

Both Semantic Kernel and AutoGen have benefited significantly from the open-source community,
and we expect the same for Agent Framework. The Microsoft Agent Framework will continue to welcome contributions from the open-source community, and improve over time with new features and capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Agent Framework is currently in public preview. Please submit any feedback or issues on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the Microsoft Agent Framework to build applications that operate with third-party servers or agents, you do so at your own risk. We recommend reviewing all data being shared with third-party servers or agents and being cognizant of third-party practices for retention and location of data. It is your responsibility to manage whether your data will flow outside of your organizationâ€™s Azure compliance and geographic boundaries and any related implications.

## Installation

Python:

```bash
pip install agent-framework
```

.NET:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI
```

## AI Agents

### What is an AI agent?

An **AI agent** is an entity that uses an LLM to process user inputs, make decisions,
and perform actions using [tools](../user-guide/agents/agent-tools.md) or [MCP servers](../user-guide/model-context-protocol/index.md).
and generate responses.
The following diagram illustrates the core components and their interactions in an AI agent:

![AI Agent Diagram](../media/agent.svg)

Note that an AI agent can also be added with additional components such as
[thread](../user-guide/agents/multi-turn-conversation.md),
[context provider](../user-guide/agents/agent-memory.md),
and [middleware](../user-guide/agents/agent-middleware.md)
to enhance its capabilities.

### When to use an AI agent?

AI agents are suitable for applications that require autonomous decision-making,
ad-hoc planning, trial-and-error exploration, and conversation-based user interactions.
It is particularly useful for scenarios when the input task is unstructured and cannot be
easily defined in advance.

Here are some common scenarios where AI agents excel:

- **Customer Support**: AI agents can handle multi-modal queries (text, voice, images)
  from customers, use tools to look up information, and provide natural language responses.
- **Education and Tutoring**: AI agents can leverage external knowledge bases to provide
  personalized tutoring and answer student questions.
- **Code Generation and Debugging**: for software developers, AI agents can assist with
  implementation, code reviews and debugging by using various programming tools and environments.
- **Research Assistance**: for researchers and analysts, AI agents can search the web,
  summarize documents, and piece together information from multiple sources.

The key is that AI agents are designed to operate in a dynamic and underspecified
setting, where the exact sequence of steps to fulfill a user request is not known
in advance and may require exploration and close collaboration with users.

### When not to use an AI agent?

AI agents are not well-suited for tasks that are highly structured and require
strict adherence to predefined rules.
If your application anticipates a specific kind of input and has a well-defined
sequence of operations to perform, using AI agents may introduce unnecessary
uncertainty, latency and cost.

_If you can write a function to handle the task, do that instead of using an AI agent. You can use AI to help you write that function._

A single AI agent may also struggle with complex tasks that involve multiple steps
and decision points. Such tasks may also require using a huge number of tools (e.g., over 20)
that are not feasible for a single agent to manage.

In these cases, consider using workflows instead.

## Workflows

### What is a Workflow?

A **workflow** can express a predefined sequence of operations that can include AI agents as components while maintaining consistency and reliability. Workflows are designed to handle complex and long-running processes that may involve multiple agents, human interactions and integrations with external systems.

The execution sequence of a workflow can be explicitly defined, allowing for more control over the execution path. The following diagram illustrates an example of a workflow that connects two AI agents and a function:

![Workflow Diagram](../media/workflow.svg)

Workflows can also express dynamic sequences by making use of
conditional routing, model-based decision making, and concurrent
execution. This is how our [multi-agent orchestration patterns](../user-guide//workflows/orchestrations/overview.md) are implemented.
The orchestration patterns provide mechanisms to coordinate multiple agents
to work on complex tasks that require multiple steps and decision points,
addressing the limitations of single agents.

### What problems do Workflows solve?

Workflows provide a structured way to manage complex processes that involve multiple steps, decision points, and interactions with various systems or agents. The types of tasks workflows are designed to handle often require more than one AI agent.

Here are some of the key benefits of Agent Framework workflows:

- **Modularity**: Workflows can be broken down into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to manage and update individual parts of the process.
- **Agent Integration**: Workflows can incorporate multiple AI agents with non-agentic components, allowing for sophisticated orchestration of tasks.
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing ensures messages flow correctly between components, with comprehensive validation that prevents runtime errors.
- **Flexible Flow**: Graph-based architecture allows for intuitive modeling of complex workflows with `executors` and `edges`. Conditional routing, parallel processing, and dynamic execution paths are all supported.
- **External Integration**: Built-in request/response patterns for seamless integration with external APIs, and human-in-the-loop scenarios.
- **Checkpointing**: Save workflow states via checkpoints, enabling recovery and resumption of long-running processes on server sides.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Built-in patterns for coordinating multiple AI agents, including sequential, concurrent, hand-off, and magentic.
- **Composability**: Workflows can be nested or combined to create more complex processes, allowing for scalability and adaptability.
