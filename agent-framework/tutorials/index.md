# Agent Framework Tutorials

Welcome to the Agent Framework tutorials! This section is designed to help you quickly learn how to build, run, and extend agents using the Agent Framework. Whether you're new to agents or looking to deepen your understanding, these step-by-step guides will walk you through essential concepts such as creating agents, managing conversations, integrating function tools, handling approvals, producing structured output, persisting state, and adding telemetry. Start with the basics and progress to more advanced scenarios to unlock the full potential of agent-based solutions.


## Agent getting started tutorials

These samples cover the essential capabilities of the Agent Framework. You'll learn how to create agents, enable multi-turn conversations, integrate function tools, add human-in-the-loop approvals, generate structured outputs, persist conversation history, and monitor agent activity with telemetry. Each tutorial is designed to help you build practical solutions and understand the core features step by step.
