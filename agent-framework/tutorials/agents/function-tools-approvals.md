# Using function tools with human in the loop approvals


This tutorial step shows you how to use function tools that require human approval with an agent, where the agent is built on the Azure OpenAI Chat Completion service.

When agents require any user input, for example to approve a function call, this is referred to as a human-in-the-loop pattern.
An agent run that requires user input, will complete with a response that indicates what input is required from the user, instead of completing with a final answer.
The caller of the agent is then responsible for getting the required input from the user, and passing it back to the agent as part of a new agent run.

## Prerequisites

For prerequisites and installing nuget packages, see the [Create and run a simple agent](./run-agent.md) step in this tutorial.

## Creating the agent with function tools

When using functions, it's possible to indicate for each function, whether it requires human approval before being executed.
This is done by wrapping the `AIFunction` instance in an `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction` instance.

Here is an example of a simple function tool that fakes getting the weather for a given location.
For simplicity we are also listing all required usings for this sample here.

```csharp
using System;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Linq;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;
using OpenAI;

[Description("Get the weather for a given location.")]
static string GetWeather([Description("The location to get the weather for.")] string location)
    => $"The weather in {location} is cloudy with a high of 15Â°C.";
```

To create an `AIFunction` and then wrap it in an `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`, you can do the following:

```csharp
AIFunction weatherFunction = AIFunctionFactory.Create(GetWeather);
AIFunction approvalRequiredWeatherFunction = new ApprovalRequiredAIFunction(weatherFunction);
```

When creating the agent, we can now provide the approval requiring function tool to the agent, by passing a list of tools to the `CreateAIAgent` method.

```csharp
AIAgent agent = new AzureOpenAIClient(
    new Uri("https://<myresource>.openai.azure.com"),
    new AzureCliCredential())
     .GetChatClient("gpt-4o-mini")
     .CreateAIAgent(instructions: "You are a helpful assistant", tools: [approvalRequiredWeatherFunction]);
```

Since we now have a function that requires approval, the agent may respond with a request for approval, instead of executing the function directly and returning the result.
We can check the response content for any `FunctionApprovalRequestContent` instances, which indicates that the agent requires user approval for a function.

```csharp
AgentThread thread = agent.GetNewThread();
AgentRunResponse response = await agent.RunAsync("What is the weather like in Amsterdam?", thread);

var functionApprovalRequests = response.Messages
    .SelectMany(x => x.Contents)
    .OfType<FunctionApprovalRequestContent>()
    .ToList();
```

If there are any function approval requests, the detail of the function call including name and arguments can be found in the `FunctionCall` property on the `FunctionApprovalRequestContent` instance.
This can be shown to the user, so that they can decide whether to approve or reject the function call.
For our example, we will assume there is one request.

```csharp
FunctionApprovalRequestContent requestContent = functionApprovalRequests.First();
Console.WriteLine($"We require approval to execute '{requestContent.FunctionCall.Name}'");
```

Once the user has provided their input, we can create a `FunctionApprovalResponseContent` instance using the `CreateResponse` method on the `FunctionApprovalRequestContent`.
Pass `true` to approve the function call, or `false` to reject it.

The response content can then be passed to the agent in a new `User` `ChatMessage`, along with the same thread object to get the result back from the agent.

```csharp
var approvalMessage = new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, [requestContent.CreateResponse(true)]);
Console.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync(approvalMessage, thread));
```

Whenever you are using function tools with human in the loop approvals, remember to check for `FunctionApprovalRequestContent` instances in the response, after each agent run, until all function calls have been approved or rejected.
