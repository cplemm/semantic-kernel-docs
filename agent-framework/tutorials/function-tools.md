# Using function tools with an agent

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

This tutorial step shows you how to use function tools with an agent, where the agent is built on the Azure OpenAI Chat Completion service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all agent types support function tools. Some may only support custom built-in tools, without allowing the caller to provide their own functions. In this step we are using a `ChatClientAgent`, which does support function tools.

## Prerequisites

For prerequisites and installing nuget packages, see the [Create and run a simple agent](./run-agent.md) step in this tutorial.

## Creating the agent with function tools

Function tools are just custom code that you want the agent to be able to call when needed.
You can turn any C# method into a function tool, by using the `AIFunctionFactory.Create` method to create an `AIFunction` instance from the method.

If you need to provide additional descriptions about the function or its parameters to the agent, so that it can more accurately choose between different functions, you can use the `System.ComponentModel.DescriptionAttribute` attribute on the method and its parameters.

Here is an example of a simple function tool that fakes getting the weather for a given location.
It is decorated with description attributes to provide additional descriptions about itself and its location parameter to the agent.

```csharp
[Description("Get the weather for a given location.")]
static string GetWeather([Description("The location to get the weather for.")] string location)
    => $"The weather in {location} is cloudy with a high of 15Â°C.";
```

When creating the agent, we can now provide the function tool to the agent, by passing a list of tools to the `CreateAIAgent` method.

```csharp
AIAgent agent = new AzureOpenAIClient(
    new Uri("https://<myresource>.openai.azure.com"),
    new AzureCliCredential())
     .GetChatClient("gpt-4o-mini")
     .CreateAIAgent(instructions: "You are a helpful assistant", tools: [AIFunctionFactory.Create(GetWeather)]);
```

Now we can just run the agent as normal, and the agent will be able to call the `GetWeather` function tool when needed.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync("What is the weather like in Amsterdam?"));
```
